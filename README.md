# Stunting Detection in Toddlers Using Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification
## Project Portofolio Machine Learning Prediction Model

Stunting is the impaired growth and development that children experience from poor nutrition, repeated infection, and inadequate psychosocial stimulation. Children are defined as stunted if their height-for-age is more than two standard deviations below the WHO Child Growth Standards median.

Stunting detection in toddlers is a critical aspect of early childhood health monitoring, as it directly correlates with long-term physical and cognitive development. One of the emerging techniques for stunting detection is the application of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification. SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is widely used for classification tasks due to its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data and providing accurate results even with small datasets. In the context of stunting detection, SVM can be used to classify toddlers into categories like severely stunted, stunted, normal, and tall based on various input features such as such as age, height, weight, and other nutritional indicators.  The SVM model works by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes with the maximum margin, thus ensuring the most reliable prediction. 

The dataset used in this study is sourced from Kaggle.com. This dataset contains detailed information relevant to stunting detection in toddlers, including variables such as age, gender, height, and nutritional status.
